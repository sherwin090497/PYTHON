# Python uses the sharp/pound/hash character to deliniate the beginning of a 
# source code comment. 

print("hello")   # this is an inline comment; many style guides frown on this
print("there.")  # they prefer comments at the beginning of a line.  

# Unlike c-style languages, Python does not support multi-line comments. 
# Consequently, developers must type a new # at the beginning of each line

# Python also supports docstrings or Python documentation strings. These may
# span multiple lines, so developers sometimes cheat and use them to 
# simulate a multi-line comment. Many style guides frown on this, so we avoid
# using them in this class as a comment mechanism. We will cover them with 
# functions.
