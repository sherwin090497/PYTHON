# Expressions evaluate to a number we can store in a variable (or not)

# The following lines all evaluate to a value: expressions in Python
1 + 2
89.64
'hello'
"there"

# these evaluate to either a True or False
1 < 2
2 != 2
2 == 2

# An 'assignment statement' binds the value of the expression on the right of
# the equal sign to the name on the left hand side. Here, we give 'ness' 3.50
